# postgres-kafka-demo

### Build the connect image

```
docker build -t debezium-connect -f debezium.Dockerfile .
```

### Bring up the entire environment

```
docker-compose up -d
```

## Loading data into Postgres

We will bring up a container with a psql command line, mount our local data
files inside, create a database called `students`, and load the data on
students' chance of admission into the `admission` table.

```
docker run -it --rm --network=postgres-kafka-demo_default \
         -v "$PWD":/home/data/ \
         debezium/postgres:11 psql -h postgres -U postgres
```

Password = postgres

At the command line:

```
CREATE DATABASE students;
\connect students;
```

Load our admission data table:

```
CREATE TABLE admission
(student_id INTEGER, gre INTEGER, toefl INTEGER, cpga DOUBLE PRECISION, admit_chance DOUBLE PRECISION,
CONSTRAINT student_id_pk PRIMARY KEY (student_id));

\copy admission FROM '/home/config/admit_1.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

Load the research data table with:

```
CREATE TABLE research
(student_id INTEGER, rating INTEGER, research INTEGER,
PRIMARY KEY (student_id));

\copy research FROM '/home/config/research_1.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

## Connect Postgres database as a source to Kafka

The postgres-source.json file contains the configuration settings needed to
sink all of the students database to Kafka.

```
curl -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data @postgres-source.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

The connector 'postgres-source' should show up when curling for the list
of existing connectors:

```
curl -H "Accept:application/json" localhost:8083/connectors/
```

The two tables in the `students` database will now show up as topics in Kafka.
You can check this by entering the Kafka container:

```
docker exec -it <kafka-container-id> /bin/bash
```

and listing the available topics:

```
/usr/bin/kafka-topics --list --zookeeper zookeeper:2181
```

```
/usr/bin/kafka-console-consumer.sh --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test --from-beginning

```

## Create tables in KSQL

Bring up a KSQL server command line client as a container:

```
docker run --network postgres-kafka-demo_default \
           --interactive --tty --rm \
           confluentinc/cp-ksql-cli:latest \
           http://ksql-server:8088
```

To see your updates, a few settings need to be configured by first running:

```
set 'commit.interval.ms'='2000';
set 'cache.max.bytes.buffering'='10000000';
set 'auto.offset.reset'='earliest';
```

### Mirror Postgres tables

The Postgres table topics will be visible in KSQL, and we will create
KSQL streams to auto update KSQL tables mirroring the Postgres tables:

```
SHOW TOPICS;

CREATE STREAM admission_src (student_id INTEGER, gre INTEGER, toefl INTEGER, cpga DOUBLE, admit_chance DOUBLE)\
WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='dbserver1.public.admission', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');

CREATE STREAM admission_src_rekey WITH (PARTITIONS=1) AS \
SELECT * FROM admission_src PARTITION BY student_id;

SHOW STREAMS;

CREATE TABLE admission (student_id INTEGER, gre INTEGER, toefl INTEGER, cpga DOUBLE, admit_chance DOUBLE)\
WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='ADMISSION_SRC_REKEY', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO', KEY='student_id');

SHOW TABLES;

CREATE STREAM research_src (student_id INTEGER, rating INTEGER, research INTEGER)\
WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='dbserver1.public.research', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO');

CREATE STREAM research_src_rekey WITH (PARTITIONS=1) AS \
SELECT * FROM research_src PARTITION BY student_id;

CREATE TABLE research (student_id INTEGER, rating INTEGER, research INTEGER)\
WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='RESEARCH_SRC_REKEY', VALUE_FORMAT='AVRO', KEY='student_id');
```

Currently KSQL uses uppercase casing convention for stream, table, and field
names.

### Create downstream tables

We will create a new KSQL streaming table to join students' chance of
admission with research experience.

```
CREATE TABLE research_boost AS \
  SELECT a.student_id as student_id, \
         a.admit_chance as admit_chance, \
         r.research as research \
  FROM admission a \
  LEFT JOIN research r on a.student_id = r.student_id;
```

and another table calculating the average chance of admission for
students with and without research experience:

```
CREATE TABLE research_ave_boost AS \
     SELECT research, SUM(admit_chance)/COUNT(admit_chance) as ave_chance \
     FROM research_boost \
     WITH (KAFKA_TOPIC='research_ave_boost', VALUE_FORMAT='delimited', KEY='research') \
     GROUP BY research;
```

## Add a connector to sink a KSQL table back to Postgres

The postgres-sink.json configuration file will create a RESEARCH_AVE_BOOST
table and send the data back to Postgres.

```
curl -X POST -H "Accept:application/json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      --data @postgres-sink.json http://localhost:8083/connectors
```

## Update the source Postgres tables and watch the Postgres sink table update

The RESEARCH_AVE_BOOST table should now be available in Postgres to query:

```
SELECT "AVE_CHANCE" FROM "RESEARCH_AVE_BOOST"
  WHERE cast("RESEARCH" as INT)=0;
```

With these data the average admission chance will be 65.19%.

Note that the tables are forced to upper case and case sensitive.
The research field needs to be cast because it has been typed as text
instead of integer, which may be a bug in KSQL or Connect.

Add some new data to the admission and research tables in Postgres:

```
\copy admission FROM '/home/data/admit_2.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
\copy research FROM '/home/data/research_2.csv' DELIMITER ',' CSV HEADER
```

With the same query above on the RESEARCH_AVE_BOOST table, the
average chance of admission for students without research experience
has been updated to 63.49%.
